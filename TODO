== Libparsing
== Todo

[ ] Flags for parsing elements:
	1) FLAG_CONTEXT: a new context is created for the element
	2) FLAG_EMPTY: an element that might consume 0 input (useful for recursion detection)

[ ] Proper *_free implementation and binding in the Python lib

[ ] Stats: bytes processed, times taken, per-symbol tries, total tries, throughput
[ ] Parsing: Memoization with option to disable it

[ ] Context: Optional context to store variables
[ ] Grammar: Dynamic symbols update

[ ] Prealloc: a lot of time in spent in Mallocs. Doing flyweight Match would
    probably speed up 5-10%

[ ] Match_isSuccess: We could scrape another 1% by inline it or simplifying it.
[ ] ParsingStats_registerMatch  takes 3.7%, we should put it as an option
