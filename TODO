== Libparsing
== Todo

[ ] Proper *_free implementation and binding in the Python lib
[ ] DEBUG_IF should be LOG_IF
[ ] verbose mode in the grammar
[ ] Stats: bytes processed, times taken, per-symbol tries, total tries, throughput
[ ] Parsing: Memoization with option to disable it
[ ] Context: Optional context to store variables
[ ] Grammar: Dynamic symbols update

[ ] Prealloc: a lot of time in spent in Mallocs. Doing flyweight Match would
    probably speed up 5-10%
[ ] Match_isSuccess: We could scrape another 1% by inline it or simplifying it.
[ ] ParsingStats_registerMatch  takes 3.7%, we should put it as an option
